## **Caesar Cipher Guide**

Welcome to the Caesar Cipher program! This guide will help you understand how to use the Caesar Cipher to encode and decode messages.

## How to Use

1. **Start the Program:**
   - The program will display a welcome logo.

2. **Choose Action:**
   - You will be prompted to type `'encode'` to encrypt a message or `'decode'` to decrypt a message.

3. **Enter Message:**
   - Type the message you want to encode or decode. The message should be in lowercase letters.

4. **Enter Shift Amount:**
   - Enter the shift number (how many positions each letter should be shifted in the alphabet).

5. **View Result:**
   - The program will display the encoded or decoded text based on your inputs.

6. **Restart or Exit:**
   - After viewing the result, you will be asked if you want to restart the cipher. Type `'yes'` to restart or `'no'` to exit.
   - If you choose to exit, the program will thank you and display a goodbye message.

## Additional Information

- The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in the message by the specified amount. For example, with a shift of 3, 'a' becomes 'd', 'b' becomes 'e', and so on.
- If the shift amount is greater than 26, it will be reduced using modulo 26.
- Non-alphabet characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation) will not be shifted and will remain in their original position.
- Enjoy encoding and decoding your secret messages!
