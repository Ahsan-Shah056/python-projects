## **Hangman Game Guide**

Welcome to the Hangman Game! This guide will help you understand how to play and enjoy the classic word-guessing game.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game:**
   - The game will display a welcome logo.
   - A random word will be chosen from a predefined list, and the length of the word will be displayed as underscores.

2. **Guess Letters:**
   - You will be prompted to guess a letter. Type a letter and press Enter.
   - If the guessed letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the correct positions.
   - If the guessed letter is not in the word, you will lose a life and be informed that the letter is not part of the word.
   - If you guess the same letter more than once, you will be notified that you've already guessed that letter.

3. **Win or Lose:**
   - The game continues until you either guess all the letters in the word or run out of lives.
   - You have a total of 6 lives. Each incorrect guess reduces your lives by one.
   - If you guess all the letters correctly before running out of lives, you win!
   - If you run out of lives, you lose, and the game will reveal the correct word.

4. **Game Display:**
   - The current state of the word will be displayed after each guess, showing correctly guessed letters and underscores for remaining letters.
   - A visual representation of the hangman will be displayed, updating with each incorrect guess to show the remaining lives.

## Additional Information
