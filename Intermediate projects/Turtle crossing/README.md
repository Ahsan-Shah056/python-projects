# Turtle Crossing Game Guide

Welcome to the Turtle Crossing Game! This guide will help you understand how to play and enjoy the game built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game:**
   - The game will initialize a 600x600 pixel screen.

2. **Control the Player (Turtle):**
   - Use the **Up Arrow** key to move the turtle up.

3. **Objective:**
   - The goal is to move the turtle across the screen to the top without colliding with the moving cars.

4. **Game Mechanics:**
   - **Cars:** Cars will be created and move horizontally across the screen.
   - **Levels:** Each time the turtle successfully reaches the top, the level increases, the game speed increases, and the turtle returns to the starting position.

5. **Collision Detection:**
   - The game checks for collisions between the turtle and the cars. If a collision is detected, the game ends and the final score is displayed.

6. **Game Over:**
   - If the turtle collides with a car, the game will end, and a game over message will be displayed.
   - You can exit the game by clicking on the screen.

## Additional Information

- The game uses object-oriented principles, with separate classes for the player (turtle), car manager, and scoreboard, allowing for modular and organized code.
- The car manager handles the creation and movement of cars, while the scoreboard keeps track of the player's progress and level.
