# **Python Projects**

## **Overview**
This repository contains all the projects I have created since I started my Python programming journey. It serves as a comprehensive showcase of my progress, starting from the very basics and gradually including more advanced projects as I enhance my skills.

## **Current Stage: Basic Projects**
- **Basic Projects:** The initial projects in this repository reflect my learning at the grassroots level. These projects cover fundamental concepts of Python, including basic syntax, control structures, data types, and simple algorithms.

## **Future Stages: Intermediate and Advanced Projects**
- **Intermediate Projects:** As I progress, I will add more complex projects that involve object-oriented programming, data structures, file handling, and basic libraries such as `math` and `datetime`.
- **Advanced Projects:** The repository will be continually updated with advanced projects involving web development, data analysis, machine learning, and other sophisticated applications as I expand my knowledge and expertise in Python.

## **Goals and Vision**
The primary goal of this repository is to document my learning path and share my projects with the community. It is a testament to my continuous effort to improve my programming skills and apply Python to solve real-world problems.

## **Usage**
Feel free to explore the projects, use the code, and provide feedback. Each project contains a README file with specific details and instructions for running the code.

Stay tuned for regular updates as I continue to learn and develop more complex and exciting projects in Python.
