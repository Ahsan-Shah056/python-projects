# **Python Projects**

## **Overview**

This repository contains all the projects I have created since I started my Python programming journey. It serves as a comprehensive showcase of my progress, starting from the very basics and gradually including more advanced projects as I enhance my skills. The purpose of showcasing all of these projects is to help newcomers by providing them with some projects that they can do while learning Python.

## **Current Stage: Intermediate Projects**

- **Basic Projects:** The initial projects in this repository reflect my learning at the grassroots level. These projects cover fundamental concepts of Python, including basic syntax, control structures, data types, and simple algorithms.
- **Intermediate Projects:** I have now moved on to more complex projects that involve object-oriented programming, data structures, file handling, and basic libraries such as `pandas` and `tkinter` etc  .

## **Future Stages: Advanced Projects**

- **Advanced Projects:** The repository will be continually updated with advanced projects involving web development, data analysis, machine learning, and other sophisticated applications as I expand my knowledge and expertise in Python.
- **Professional Portfolio Projects:** After completing all of the projects in this repository, I will be creating different repositories to showcase professional portfolio projects.

## **Goals and Vision**

The primary goal of this repository is to document my learning path and share my projects with the community. It is a testament to my continuous effort to improve my programming skills and apply Python to solve real-world problems. By sharing these projects, I also aim to assist newcomers in finding practical projects they can work on while learning Python.

## **Usage**

Feel free to explore the projects, use the code, and provide feedback. Each project contains a README file with specific details and instructions for running the code.

Stay tuned for regular updates as I continue to learn and develop more complex and exciting projects in Python.
